OK Guys,

To get this working on your machines..

I think you'll need the newest version of Xcode (6.1) as that is what i will be using, though older versions may work.

youll also need a github usename and password if you dont have one already

Xcode is available through the mac App Store.

Now youll want to open a terminal window, go to the folder where you want to place this code, and type:

git clone https://github.com/lhaber9/WTB.git

once you have the code open with Xcode and you should be able to run the code by clicking the play button on the top left of the xcode window.
